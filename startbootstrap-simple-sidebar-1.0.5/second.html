                        <p>I am graduating Bangkok Patana School at 2017. I study HL CS, Maths, Physics and SL English Lang/Lit, Spanish and Economics. I love many things, most of my hobbies rely on technology. I consider my self as a coder who has passion for both front end and back end developing. And finally my dream journey in life would be to blitz scale a startup.</code></p>
                        <p>My favourite subject would be Computer Science because it is so flexible andt the feeling of creating something out of nothing is something you may not achieve from any other field. Also it is very independant and can evoke a lot of creativity.</p>

                        <p>
GoPomelo work with companies to transform the way they collaborate, work and engage with customers. We partner with leading technology and develop our own applications in-house. I was there to learn how to both front end and back end develop. We were given the task of re-creating some of the flaws within our school map navigation. Ultimately we evaluated the flaws and created a better page. We used Materialize and Google Maps API to help users navigate the location to our school. We tried our best to make it as efficent as possible, so we used buttons and plugged all functions onto one page to avoid loading delay. It was largely beneficial to my understanding of front end developing. Because of my skills taught there I was able to create this page.

                        <p>
Model United Nations is one of my favourite things to do outside of school. It is a highly competitive atmosphere. I have been to 4-5 conferences and chaired one conference. I have learnt to callaborate with peers and also learnt to understand the significance of current affairs revolving world politics. I am also about to compete in my first international conference in Singapore in March, it is called SEASAC MUN. The most imporatnt thing I have learnt in MUN is to always consier the other perspective when making an important decision. Because any decision can affect your life in the future. This also ties in with the passion to create a startup because you make an enormous amount of decisions when creating a startup.

                        <p>
One of my greatest passions is to help animals and others who may not be as fortunate as our society. I love the feeling of give back to the community, is a feeling that cannot be described. I have participated for 1 year in playing with under privilaged kids in grade 9, teaching them colouring and some English but overall our aim was to bring hapiness in their lives. I am also helping to raise awareness and funds for the organisation named WFFT, our club is called SOS. Another way I help is to bring the voice of my class in the Student Representitive Council. Right now my favourite passion is to teach English to underprivilaged kids in Bangkok, this is because not only do the kids learn English but also I learn from the kids. I have learnt to be myself and to always be learning even if you think you know everything. My best experience was when a girl finished our worksheets within seconds but after knowing everything she practised more, when we asked her if she thought it was easy she said "There is no harm in triyng to perfect".

1)  The Expenditure Approach

This method of determining GDP adds up the market value of all domestic expenditures made on final goods and services in a single year, including consumption expenditures, investment expenditures, government expenditures, and net exports. Add all of the expenditures together and you determine GDP.
</p>
<p>
2) The Production Approach
This method also called the Net Product or Value added method requires three stages of analysis. First gross value of output from all sectors is estimated. Then, intermediate consumption such as cost of materials, supplies and services used in production final output is derived. Then gross output is reduced by intermediate consumption to develop net production.
</p>
<p>
3) The Income Approach

This method of determining GDP is to add up all the income earned by households and firms in the year. The total expenditures on all of the final goods and services are also income received as wages, profits, rents, and interest income. By adding together all of the wages, profits, rents, and interest income, you determine GDP.
